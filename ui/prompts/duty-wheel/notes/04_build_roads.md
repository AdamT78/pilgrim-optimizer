## Version A — engraved plate

Save as **`04_build_roads_A.png`**

```
Nineteenth-century steel-engraving style, dense cross-hatching, sepia and warm grey ink on aged paper. Fourteenth-century English setting. Even, neutral illumination across the whole frame - no dramatic side-light, no glow, no spotlight, no vignette. Overall tonal value light to middle, as a book illustration printed on cream paper: most of the picture in light and middle tones, with dark ink reserved for accents and never covering large areas. High detail but bold, readable forms.

Workmen building a stone bridge over a stream, one setting a kerb, a wayside shrine beyond.

Square 1:1. Full bleed to all four edges - no border, no frame, no parchment margin, no torn edge, no caption or text of any kind. Keep the outer 6 per cent of the picture clear of anything important.
```

## Version B — grim dark Gothic

Save as **`04_build_roads_B.png`**

```
Fourteenth-century England in a grim, oppressive register. Heavy gothic architecture crowding the frame, weather-stained stone, bare branches, crows, guttering candles, faces gaunt and weary. Dense engraved cross-hatching in cold iron-grey and black ink, bitten deep. Overcast and joyless. Even illumination across the whole frame - no spotlight, no glow, no vignette - but a low, sunless key throughout. Blacks rich and detailed, never flat or blocked up; the cross-hatching must stay separable everywhere, with no solid black masses. High detail, bold readable silhouettes.

Men driving piles into a black river beneath the ruin of an older bridge, crows lined along the broken parapet.

Square 1:1. Full bleed to all four edges - no border, no frame, no parchment margin, no torn edge, no caption or text of any kind. Keep the outer 6 per cent of the picture clear of anything important.

It reports the join position, whether a rule got drawn, and the tonal key. If the join is off centre, do not regenerate — send me the number and I move the gradient.
