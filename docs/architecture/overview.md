# Architecture Overview

## Current Layering

- `pilgrim.model`: immutable/hashable domain models and config representations.
- `pilgrim.rules`: deterministic transition logic, legal action generation, and invariants.
- `pilgrim.io`: JSON scenario loading and event/replay serialization helpers.
- `pilgrim.search`: optimization routines that call rules APIs only.
- `pilgrim.cli`: thin command-line entrypoint over scenario loading + engine/search calls.

## Design Constraints

- Rules code must be deterministic and side-effect free.
- Search must not embed game rules; it consumes `legal_actions()` and `apply_action()`.
- Static game data should live in `configs/` JSON files.
- Every transition emits structured events to support replay and debugging.

## Intentionally Deferred

- Full Pilgrim rule set and board systems.
- Rich replay visualizations.
- Performance tuning and parallelized search strategies.
