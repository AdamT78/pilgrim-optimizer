# Pilgrim UI Debug Prototypes

These files are visual prototypes/baselines only.

They are not connected to `GameState`, do not implement rules, and are not the final UI.
They should be used as visual reference before future renderer extraction.

Future work can extract structured geometry/layout data one prototype at a time while preserving visual parity.

## Building tiles renderer extraction

`prototypes/building_tiles.html` is the untouched visual baseline for the building tiles.

`building_catalog.json` and `render_buildings.py` are the first structured renderer extraction:
the 24 building tiles are described as data, and the renderer draws them with geometry taken
from the baseline prototype.

Generate the output page with:

```bash
python3 tools/ui_debug/generate_buildings.py
```

This writes `generated/building_tiles.html`. Generated output is not committed; the catalog and
the renderer are.

Like the prototypes, this still does not connect to `GameState` and still does not implement
game rules.

## Player board renderer extraction

`prototypes/player_board.html` is the untouched visual baseline for the player board.

`player_board_layout.json` and `render_player_board.py` are the structured renderer extraction:
the banners, worker slots, resource counters, special-activity hex snake, and empty building
slots are described as data with coordinates reverse-engineered from the baseline prototype.

Generate the output page with:

```bash
python3 tools/ui_debug/generate_player_board.py
```

This writes `generated/player_board.html`, which is not committed.

The renderer draws a mock player state (see `default_player_state()`), so it still does not
connect to `GameState` and still does not implement game rules.
